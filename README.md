# ledstrip-night-lamp
This night lamp was designed and build as a new year present. The idea came from a fancy globe night lamps with a wake up function and quickly got out of control. 
The design was done in blender and tinkercad. It is 3d printed with a zortrax m200 printer. For the electronics it contains a teensy LC, a steel button as a capacitif touch button and an infrared remote.

A video of the light at work:

In the video you can see the different functions, out the frame I'm pushing the buttons on the remote.
It has 3 basic functions:
 - one color mode
 - two color mode, the text has a different color
 - special programs (hue color loop, color random, dual color circle, ...)

The capacitif button toggles the light on/ off.

The remote can:
 - turn the light on/off
 - change the modes
 - numbers 1 - 6: single colors modes
 - numbers 7 - 9 dual color modes
 - arrow up/down change color of he outside/inside by looping over the hue spectrum
 - arrow left/right loop over the special programs
 - -/+ buttons are for the light brightness

The design and the code are opensource so you can build it yourself.
